To conduct a literature review on the topic of "Interpretable Deep Learning Models for Medical Condition Prediction using Diagnosis, Procedure, Medication, and Lab Codes," I would recommend the following approach:

1. **Search for Recent Academic Papers:**
   - Use academic databases such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library to search for recent papers published in 2023 or the latest available.
   - Use search queries like "Interpretable Deep Learning Medical Prediction 2023" or "Deep Learning Medical Codes Interpretability."

2. **Gather Information for Each Paper:**
   - **Title:** Note the title of each relevant paper.
   - **Link:** Ensure you have a working link to access the full paper, either through open access or institutional access.
   - **Year of Publication:** Confirm the year to ensure the paper is recent.
   - **Summary:** Write a detailed summary of the paper's content, focusing on the methods used for interpretability, the types of medical codes utilized, and the outcomes of the study.

3. **Example Papers to Look For:**
   - Papers discussing the use of attention mechanisms in deep learning for interpretability.
   - Studies that integrate multiple types of medical codes (diagnosis, procedure, medication, lab) for comprehensive prediction models.
   - Research focusing on the application of explainable AI techniques in healthcare settings.

4. **Organize the Literature Review:**
   - **Background Section:** Provide an overview of the importance of interpretability in medical AI models and the challenges associated with using complex medical codes.
   - **Related Work Section:** Discuss the advancements in the field, highlighting key papers and their contributions to the development of interpretable models.

By following this approach, you can compile a thorough literature review that will form the basis of the 'Background' and 'Related Work' sections of your academic paper.
