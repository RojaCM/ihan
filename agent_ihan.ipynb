      "\n",
      "### Type 2 Diabetes (ICD10 code E11)\n",
      "**Treatment Plan:**\n",
      "1. **Lifestyle Changes:**\n",
      "   - **Diet:** Follow a healthy-eating plan that focuses on low-fat, low-calorie foods, primarily fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit sugar-sweetened beverages and high-calorie, low-nutrition foods.\n",
      "   - **Exercise:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.\n",
      "   - **Weight Management:** Losing weight can significantly improve blood sugar control.\n",
      "2. **Medication:**\n",
      "   - **Oral Diabetes Drugs:** Metformin is commonly prescribed to improve insulin sensitivity.\n",
      "   - **Insulin Therapy:** In some cases, insulin injections may be required.\n",
      "3. **Monitoring:** Regularly check blood sugar levels to ensure they are within the target range.\n",
      "4. **Mental Health Care:** Engage in stress management techniques and seek support if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dietary Restrictions:**\n",
      "1. **Carbohydrate Counting:** Monitor carbohydrate intake to help manage blood sugar levels.\n",
      "2. **Healthy Fats:** Choose healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and olive oil over saturated and trans fats.\n",
      "3. **Limit Sodium:** Reducing salt intake can help control blood pressure, which is important as diabetes increases the risk of hypertension.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chronic Kidney Disease (ICD10 code N18)\n",
      "**Treatment Plan:**\n",
      "1. **Lifestyle Changes:**\n",
      "   - **Blood Pressure Control:** Maintain blood pressure within target levels, often through a combination of medication and lifestyle changes.\n",
      "   - **Diabetes Management:** Keep blood sugar levels under control.\n",
      "2. **Medication:**\n",
      "   - **Blood Pressure Medications:** ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often prescribed to protect kidney function.\n",
      "   - **Diuretics:** To help manage swelling and fluid retention.\n",
      "3. **Regular Monitoring:** Frequent blood tests to monitor kidney function and electrolyte levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dietary Restrictions:**\n",
      "1. **Protein Intake:** Limit protein consumption to reduce the burden on the kidneys.\n",
      "2. **Sodium Restriction:** Keep sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day to manage blood pressure.\n",
      "3. **Potassium and Phosphorus:** Depending on kidney function, you may need to limit foods high in potassium (bananas, oranges) and phosphorus (dairy products, nuts).\n",
      "4. **Fluid Intake:** Depending on the stage of kidney disease, fluid intake may need to be restricted to prevent fluid overload.\n",

      "Final Answer: In medical terms, NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a specialized branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. In healthcare, NLP is used to analyze and extract meaningful information from unstructured medical texts, such as clinical notes, electronic health records (EHRs), and research articles. This technology helps in improving patient care by enabling the automated extraction of important medical information, aiding in clinical decision support, and enhancing the efficiency of administrative tasks.\u001b[0m\n",
