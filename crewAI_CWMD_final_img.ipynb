    "2. Parse the input systematically to ensure every lab test is processed and included in the summary. \n",
    "3. Consolidate all dates and results for each lab test, listing them in chronological order within square brackets. \n",
    "4. If a value or abnormal code is missing, leave it blank\n",
    "5. Use the exact abnormal code values as provided in the input, without any transformation or mapping. \n",
    "6. Categorize lab tests into appropriate groups based on the test type. \n",
    "7. Tests without a clear category should be listed as stand-alone items. \n",
    "8. Prioritize more serious and then recent lab categories at the top. \n",
    "9. Within each category, prioritize more serious and recent lab tests at the top\n",
    "10. Each lab test should appear only once in the summary, without duplication, consolidating all associated details. \n",
    "11.**Before finalizing the output, verify that all lab tests and their details from the input are included in the summary.**\n",
