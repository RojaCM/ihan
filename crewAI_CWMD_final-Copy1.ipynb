    "3. Consolidate all dates and results for each lab test, listing them in chronological order within square brackets. \n",
    "4. If a value or abnormal code is missing, leave it blank\n",
    "5. Use the exact abnormal code values as provided in the input, without any transformation or mapping. \n",
    "6. Categorize lab tests into appropriate groups based on the test type. \n",
    "7. Tests without a clear category should be listed as stand-alone items. \n",
    "8. Prioritize more serious and then recent lab categories at the top. \n",
    "9. Within each category, prioritize more serious and recent lab tests at the top\n",
    "10. Each lab test should appear only once in the summary, without duplication, consolidating all associated details. \n",
    "11.**Before finalizing the output, verify that all lab tests and their details from the input are included in the summary.**\n",

      "10. Each lab test should appear only once in the summary, without duplication, consolidating all associated details. \n",

      "## Question 1: **What are the implications of my Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with complications, and how can I better manage it?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with complications, such as diabetic neuropathy and chronic kidney disease, indicates that your diabetes is affecting other parts of your body. Your HbA1c levels have been consistently high, suggesting poor glycemic control. Management involves a combination of medication, diet, and lifestyle changes. Medications like insulin, Metformin, and Pioglitazone are crucial, but so is maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and HbA1c is essential to assess the effectiveness of your management plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Importance:** Understanding the implications of your diabetes and its complications is vital for preventing further health deterioration. Discussing management strategies with your doctor can help tailor a plan that suits your lifestyle and improves your health outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Question 2: **How can I prevent the progression of my Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and what lifestyle changes should I consider?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 2 indicates mild kidney damage, which can progress if not managed properly. Key strategies include controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels, as both hypertension and diabetes are significant risk factors for CKD progression. Medications like Lisinopril and Metformin are part of this management. Lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding NSAIDs like Diclofenac can also help. Regular monitoring of kidney function through GFR and creatinine tests is crucial.\n",

      "## Question 1: **What are the implications of my Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with complications, and how can I better manage it?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with complications, such as diabetic neuropathy and chronic kidney disease, indicates that your diabetes is affecting other parts of your body. Your HbA1c levels have been consistently high, suggesting poor glycemic control. Management involves a combination of medication, diet, and lifestyle changes. Medications like insulin, Metformin, and Pioglitazone are crucial, but so is maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and HbA1c is essential to assess the effectiveness of your management plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Importance:** Understanding the implications of your diabetes and its complications is vital for preventing further health deterioration. Discussing management strategies with your doctor can help tailor a plan that suits your lifestyle and improves your health outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Question 2: **How can I prevent the progression of my Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and what lifestyle changes should I consider?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 2 indicates mild kidney damage, which can progress if not managed properly. Key strategies include controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels, as both hypertension and diabetes are significant risk factors for CKD progression. Medications like Lisinopril and Metformin are part of this management. Lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding NSAIDs like Diclofenac can also help. Regular monitoring of kidney function through GFR and creatinine tests is crucial.\n",
