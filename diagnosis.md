Based on the patient's symptoms of fever and a history of cold, the following conditions are the most likely:

1. **Influenza (Flu)**: Influenza is a viral infection that can cause fever, coughing, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue. It often follows a cold.

2. **Secondary Bacterial Infection**: After a viral cold, a secondary bacterial infection such as sinusitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia can develop, leading to fever.

3. **Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)**: Many viral URTIs initially present with cold symptoms, which can persist and develop into a fever.

4. **Sinusitis**: Inflammation of the sinuses often follows a cold and can cause fever, facial pain, and nasal congestion.

5. **Ear Infection (Otitis Media)**: A cold can lead to an ear infection, especially in children, causing fever, ear pain, and irritability.

Considering these possibilities, it is important to monitor symptoms closely and seek medical attention if the fever persists or worsens, or if other severe symptoms develop.
